# TI-108 Calculator
This is the final project for <a href = 'https://www.theodinproject.com'>The Odin Project</a> web-development foundations course. An online calculator, 
made using only pure HTML, CSS and E6S JavaScript.
For this project, I decided to replicate the calculator that I used in elementary school: the <a href ='https://education.ti.com/-/media/ti/education/images/products/product-details/basics---elementaries/ti108_product.jpg?rev=25320a03-06ae-4409-af13-af11946d5564&h=516&w=318&la=en&hash=E4C4DAF222792EDD5FEC194FEF1E68332557DAAF'>Texas Instruments TI-108</a>.

# Features
* The calculator interface is a clone of the real-life TI-108.
* Supports all basic operations (divide, multiple, remainder, add, subtract).
* Supports the additional buttons of the TI-108: roots, percent and memory storage.
* Rounds the decimals to fit in the screen. If the number is too large, displays an
  error and shows the result in a pup-up alert.
* Has an option to clear the screen and memory buttons that can store and recall
  numbers from the persistent memory.

# What I learned
* I improved my overall CSS styling capabilities.
* JavaScript event listeners
* Design modular and reusable functions
* Work with flex and grid
* Usage and combination of external fonts

# Final Result
